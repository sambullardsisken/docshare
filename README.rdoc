This is a simple single-page app I built with Backbone.js, meant for collaborative document editing. You can create documents using a basic text editor (Bootstrap wysihtml5 plug-in) and search for other users to share them with. You can edit documents that have been shared with you. The app keeps all your documents in order by last edit and lets you know who has most recently edited each document.

Note: I built this project on the app academy computers, so unfortunately most of the commits are not under my name. I promise I didn't swipe this from someone
